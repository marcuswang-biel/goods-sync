Monorepo starter for BIEL projects: a Convex backend, a Vite + React web app and an Expo app sharing one auth provider, with business rules in Effect.

Tooling: pnpm workspaces + catalog, Turborepo, oxlint (type-aware, with local `anti-slop` and Lingui rules) and oxfmt, vitest, convex-test, `@effect/vitest`, Release Please.

## Quick start

Requires Node 24 (`.nvmrc`) and pnpm 10 (`packageManager` in `package.json`; Corepack picks it up).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm worktree:setup   # once per checkout/worktree: local Convex backend, auth env, dev user
pnpm dev              # web + backend
```

Open the URL `worktree:setup` prints (default http://localhost:3001). How to sign in (and the dev login, where there is one) is in `docs/auth.md`.

Native: `pnpm dev:native`, then open the app in a simulator or development build. `apps/native/.env.local` points at `127.0.0.1`; use your machine's LAN IP for a physical device.

`worktree:setup` only ever creates a local anonymous Convex backend. It refuses to run against a cloud deployment. Each git worktree gets its own backend and its own web port in 3001–3010.

## Start a new project from this template

1. On GitHub, **Use this template** → create the repo, then clone it.
2. Rename the placeholder identity (`goods` / `物資`) everywhere, on a clean tree:

   ```bash
   node scripts/rename.mjs billing "Billing Portal"
   pnpm install
   pnpm check
   ```

   This rewrites the npm scope (`@goods/*` → `@billing/*`), the Expo slug, scheme and bundle id (`com.goods.app` → `com.billing.app`), storage keys and display names. Review `git diff` before committing.

3. The domain is one shared shelf: `packages/domain/src/stock`, `packages/backend/convex/{stock,spaces,purchases}.ts`, and the board in `apps/web` and `apps/native`. Keep the pattern (ADR 0001). There is no home or office kind.
4. Fill in `CONTEXT.md`.
5. Production setup (not done by the template): a Convex project and `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`, Vercel project secrets (`VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`), `EXPO_TOKEN` and an EAS project for native, and the auth provider config in `docs/auth.md`.
